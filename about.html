								<h1>Savage Love Wine</h1>						
								<div class="blog-detail">Posted <span>12 March 2022</span></div>

								<div class="blog-content">
									<p>This project is about the branding and packaging of wine.  Savage Love Distillery was founded in 2018 by a group of young people with a strong passion for wine, a delicate and emotional drink.</p>
									<p>Savage Love was born in Ninh Thuan, which is known as the land of sun and wind. With the scorching heat of the land, Ninh Thuan has a characteristic fierce and intense character. But in contrast to that thorny, this land is the place to nurture the famous sweet ripe grapes. It is like a gift of nature, the best ingredient to create a delicate drink called wine.<br> With that great inspiration, we decided to distill the harshness of Ninh Thuan land, mix with a little ecstatic emotion when people are immersed in love, thereby creating the name Savage Love, symbolizing an intense and endless love.</p>
									<blockquote>
									Life is better with wine. It is the slogan of the brand that shows a personality that is hearty and fun. Savage Love aims to become a representative brand of Vietnam, introduce to international friends the beauty of nature, culture, and people, and raise the value of precious products from this land of letters.&nbsp;Savage Love exists with the philosophy that when the products reach the users, they must be the complete products from the taste, design, and hidden message behind each product.</blockquote>
									<p>
									It is one of my proud achievements that I spent a lot of time on that why I always make sure the style and the voice of the brand go right in the direction. The logo style is minimalistic, so I fix every detail to have some curves that speak elegant and open to show the spirit of the brand's hope. As a team leader, I have responsibility for making the logo and layout for packaging. Through this project I learn a lot:&nbsp; </p>
									<ul class="list-style">
									  <li> Always communicate with the team so we can understand each other views. If a team member gets lost on the track, I will help them know what they should do.</li>
										<li> Believe in yourself that you can do it. That is the spirit I can go through any difficulties.</li>
										<li> Arrange the work appropriately for other members and help them when they are stuck on the idea.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Wine is an ethereal drink of European aristocrats that was introduced to Vietnam by the French during the French colonial period. The unique taste has attracted the people of Annam, who are familiar with wines made from rice and sticky rice. <br><br>Experiencing many ups and downs in history, echo gradually becomes closer to the Vietnamese people. From the origin of imported wine, the wineries were distilled by the skillful hands of the Vietnamese people. <br> <br>The context of the Covid-19 epidemic causes many difficulties to limit travel abroad. But this is an opportunity for us to look back and realize "Oh, Vietnam is also very beautiful - Let's go to Vietnam". With abundant inspiration from scenic spots, Savage Love wishes to breathe more Vietnamese soul into its products. With the idea of ​​"Vietnam, beauty from North to South", we decided to recreate the natural beauty of 3 regions, put on a new shirt for the brand's products.</p>
